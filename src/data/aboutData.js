    description1: "I am a Cybersecurity Professional specializing in Offensive Security, Cyber Threat Intelligence, and Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT). I deliver contract-based security support to SMEs seeking to strengthen their digital defenses, helping organizations identify vulnerabilities, simulate advanced attacks, and build resilience against evolving threats. Beyond technical operations, I design and lead Security Awareness Training (SAT) programs tailored to diverse organizational needs. These programs combine real-world attack simulations with practical, engaging instruction to reduce human risk factors and foster long-term security culture. As a seasonal instructor, I mentor aspiring cybersecurity professionals through hands-on labs and real-world projects in VAPT, OSINT, and Digital Forensics. I also work with NGOs and private firms, applying intelligence-driven investigations to uncover critical insights and combat cybercrime. By combining advanced offensive security expertise, intelligence-led investigations, and human-focused training, I provide a comprehensive approach to safeguarding businesses and empowering communities in the digital age.",
